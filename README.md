## 😤 The Problem (You Know Exactly What This Is)

Every. Single. Night. Without fail. Since the dawn of civilization (probably):

> 🧑 "What do you want for dinner?"
> 👩 "I don't know, what do YOU want?"
> 🧑 "I'm fine with anything."
> 👩 "Okay, how about pasta?"
> 🧑 "Ugh, we had pasta on Tuesday."
> 👩 "That was THREE weeks ago, Kevin."
> 🧑 "What about tacos?"
> 👩 "You say tacos every time."
> 🧑 "Because tacos are ALWAYS the right answer!"
> 👩 *opens Uber Eats for the 4th time this week*
> *(You spend $47 on pad thai and silently resent each other)*

**WhatTheFork ends this madness.** One click. One dice roll. One recipe. Zero arguments. Possibly fewer therapy bills.

## ✨ Features (aka "Things This Beautiful Little File Can Do")

### 🎲 The Dice Roller — The Star of the Show
Click the big satisfying dice (or the even bigger "Roll the Fork!" button) and watch it spin dramatically like it's auditioning for a Vegas show. It lands on a random recipe from the library. That's your dinner now. The dice have spoken. There is no appeal process.

### 🏷️ Category Filters — For People Who Have *Some* Standards
Before rolling, narrow it down by mood:
- **🎲 Anything!** — Full chaos mode. Absolute culinary roulette. May the odds be ever in your stomach's favour.
- **🍝 Italian** — Pasta, pizza, and the constant looming threat of a Roman nonna judging your technique from beyond.
- **🥢 Asian** — Curries, stir-fries, and dishes that will make you question why you ever ordered takeaway.
- **🌮 Mexican** — Tacos and more tacos. The correct answer was tacos all along. Kevin was right.
- **🧀 Comfort Food** — Burgers, cheese, and zero regret. Maximum regret tomorrow. Worth it.
- **🥗 Healthy** — For when you've eaten four smash burgers this week and your body is filing a formal complaint.
- **⚡ Quick (<30 min)** — Because it's already 8pm and someone *forgot* to defrost anything. Again.
- **✨ Impress Me** — For date nights, dinner parties, or when you need to prove you're a functioning adult with sophisticated taste.

### ✍️ My Choices Mode — Democracy in the Kitchen
Switch to **"My Choices"** mode and type in the meals you're actually debating. Add as many as you like. The dice picks one at random. Now instead of arguing with each other, you're *both* yelling at the dice. This is called growth.

Type your options → Click Roll → Dice decides → You cook it → Nobody can complain because it was **fate** and fate doesn't take criticism.

### 🔍 Find a Recipe for This — The YouTube Lifeline
When you roll a custom choice that isn't in our library (e.g. "That thing Grandma used to make," "idk some chicken thing," or "beef wellington because I've lost my mind"), the **"🔍 Find a Recipe for This"** button appears. One click and it fires a YouTube search for your exact dish so you can watch a professional make it while you nod along confidently, say "yeah yeah I got it" at the 2-minute mark, and then freestyle the whole thing anyway.

It works like this:
```
Your input:        "Beef Wellington"
YouTube search:    "Beef Wellington recipe"
Your confidence:   📈 Dangerously High
Actual result:     Edible (probably) (maybe) (fingers crossed)
```

### 📋 Full Recipe Cards — Not Just "Mix Everything Together and Hope"
Every recipe comes with:
- **Ingredient table** with checkboxes — check things off as you grab them and feel like an actual professional
- **Step-by-step instructions** that assume you're a smart adult but also gently beg you not to scramble your carbonara eggs
- **Difficulty badge** so you know if tonight is "I've got this" or "God be with me"
- **Cook time** so you can accurately calculate how late dinner will actually be

### 💡 "Make It Better" Tips — The Upgrade Pack Nobody Asked For But Everyone Needs
Each recipe includes four tip cards because we care:
- **⬆️ Level Up** — The one extra step that turns "pretty good" into "wait, did you go to culinary school??"
- **⚠️ Don't Do This** — The specific terrible mistake that will ruin everything. We're saving you from yourself. You're welcome.
- **🍷 Pair With** — Wine, beer, or other beverage suggestions. Because food tastes better with a drink and you've earned it.
- **📦 Leftovers?** — What to do with the rest tomorrow morning. (Spoiler: carbonara leftovers are a war crime. Eat it all. Tonight. Now.)

### 📖 Roll History — For the Indecisive Nostalgic
Hit **"❤️ Save to History"** and the recipe gets stored in your browser's local storage forever (or until you clear your cache, in which case: your loss). Your past rolls appear in a grid below. Click any of them to reload that recipe instantly. Perfect for remembering "wait, what was that curry we made that one time that was *incredible*?" without endlessly re-rolling for 40 minutes. Not that anyone has done that.

### 📤 Share with Partner — Pass the Blame Electronically
Click **"📤 Share with Partner"** to either:
- Launch your device's native share sheet (mobile) to send the recipe like a thoughtful, organised human
- Copy it to your clipboard (desktop) so you can paste it into chat and say *"The dice decided. Not me. Not my fault. Take it up with fate."*

### 🖨️ Print Recipe — Going Full Grandma Mode
Hit **"🖨️ Print Recipe"** for a clean, ink-friendly printout. Great for sticking on the fridge, gifting to a friend, or laminating and framing because you're really proud of yourself tonight and honestly you should be.

### 🔄 Nope, Roll Again — The Coward's Exit
Not feeling the dice's divine selection? Hit **"🔄 Nope, Roll Again"** and tempt fate once more. The dice has no feelings. The dice does not remember. But the dice is always watching.

## 🚀 Quick Start — It's Literally Just a File

No npm. No webpack. No `node_modules` folder heavier than your self-worth. Just HTML.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prajitdatta/whatthefork.git
cd whatthefork
open index.html
# Done. That's it. Go cook dinner. Shoo.
```

Want to feel like a real developer by serving it locally?

```bash
npx serve .
# OR the Python way, for those of a certain vintage:
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Then open http://localhost:8080 and feel extremely technical
```

## 🗂️ Project Structure — Shockingly, Beautifully Simple

```
whatthefork/
├── index.html     ← EVERYTHING. All the HTML. All the CSS. All the JS.
│                    One file. No drama. No build step. No tears.
└── README.md      ← You're reading this right now. Hello. 👋
```

That's the whole project. Two files. One does everything. One explains everything. We don't talk about the rogue puppeteer cache that snuck into the zip file. It doesn't spark joy. We're letting it go. 🫣

## 🤝 Contributing — We Need Your Recipes, Your Bug Reports, and Your Best Food Puns

Spotted a bug? Have a recipe that deserves to be in here? Written a funny tip that made you laugh out loud while standing alone in your kitchen? **We want all of it.**

### How to Add a Recipe

Find the `RECIPES` array in `index.html` and drop your object at the end. Here's the exact format — copy it, fill it in, submit a PR, become a legend:

```javascript
{
  id: 9,                              // Next number in sequence. Don't skip. Don't duplicate. This isn't anarchy.
  emoji: "🥩",                        // One emoji. ONE. We are not an emoji buffet.
  title: "Pan-Seared Ribeye",         // Recipe name. Be specific. "Steak" is not a name. "Steak" is a vibe.
  time: "⏱ 15 min",                  // Be honest. If it takes 45 min, say 45 min. We've been burned before.
  difficulty: "Easy",                 // Easy / Medium / Challenge — no "Gordon Ramsay" tier, we checked.
  servings: "2 servings",             // How many real humans this actually feeds
  category: "Comfort",                // Display label shown in the badge on the recipe card
  categories: ["comfort", "quick"],   // Filter tags — use any of: italian | asian | mexican | comfort | healthy | quick | fancy
  funny: "A hilarious one-liner about this dish. Make it good. Make us snort. This is your moment. 🥩",
  ingredients: [
    { name: "Ribeye steak", amount: "2 × 250g", notes: "room temperature — take it out an hour early or don't bother" },
    { name: "Butter", amount: "2 tbsp", notes: "real butter. Not that yellow imposter in a tub. Real butter." },
    // continue until the dish is complete...
  ],
  steps: [
    "Step one. Be clear. Assume the reader is intelligent but also stressed and probably hungry.",
    "Step two. Warn them about the thing they're inevitably about to do wrong.",
    "Step three. Tell them it's ready. They need to hear it.",
    // etc...
  ],
  tips: [
    { type: "upgrade",  icon: "⬆️", title: "Level Up",        text: "The one small thing that transforms it from good to unforgettable." },
    { type: "warn",     icon: "⚠️", title: "Don't Do This",   text: "The specific mistake that will ruin everything. Name it clearly." },
    { type: "wine",     icon: "🍷", title: "Pair With",        text: "A drink recommendation. 'Wine' is not a recommendation. Be specific." },
    { type: "leftover", icon: "📦", title: "Leftovers?",       text: "What to do with the rest tomorrow. Or tonight at 2am. No judgment." }
  ]
}
```

**Available filter tag categories:**
`italian` · `asian` · `mexican` · `comfort` · `healthy` · `quick` · `fancy`

A recipe can have multiple tags! A quick Thai curry can be both `asian` AND `quick`. It contains multitudes. Respect that.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack — Or: An Ode to Not Installing Things

| Layer | What | Why |
|-------|------|-----|
| Structure | Semantic HTML5 | Accessibility + SEO. Two birds, one file, zero frameworks. |
| Styling | CSS Custom Properties + Grid/Flexbox | No Tailwind required when you have MDN and two hours to spare. |
| Logic | Vanilla ES6+ JavaScript | Zero dependencies = zero supply chain attacks = zero `npm audit` nightmares at 11pm. |
| Animations | Pure CSS `@keyframes` | No GSAP. No Framer Motion. Just math and vibes. |
| Fonts | Google Fonts (Boogaloo + Nunito) | Because Comic Sans was considered and rejected. |
| Storage | `localStorage` | Browser-native. No database. No server. No Prajit's credit card. |
| Hosting | GitHub Pages | Free. Fast. Forever. The holy trinity. |

No React. No Vue. No Svelte. No Solid. No Astro. No Next. No Nuxt. No build step. No transpiler. No bundler. No monorepo. No Docker. No Kubernetes. No cloud functions. No microservices. **Just a single HTML file that you double-click and it works.** We are at peace.

## 🔍 SEO & Performance — For the Nerds, the Googlebots, and the LinkedIn Humble Braggers

- **Lighthouse 100/100** across Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO — because bragging rights are free and Prajit worked hard for these
- **Schema.org `WebApplication`** structured data so Google knows what this thing actually is
- **Open Graph tags** so when you share it, it looks like a real website and not a 4am hackathon project
- **Twitter Cards** with `summary_large_image` for when you post about your dinner, which you should, tag us
- **FAQ Section** with structured data for Google's fancy expandable search results
- **Canonical URL** so Google doesn't index the same page 14 times and get confused
- **Single file = instant load**: No JS framework boot time. No render-blocking. It loads before your partner can change their mind.

---

## 📜 License

**MIT** — Take it, fork it, remix it, deploy it on a potato. Just don't blame us if you overcook the salmon. The recipe clearly said medium heat. You chose high. You chose chaos. That's on you.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

This project is lovingly dedicated to:

- 🥺 Every couple who has spent more time deciding what to eat than actually eating it
- 🙃 Everyone who has ever said "I'm fine with anything" and then vetoed six perfectly good suggestions
- 👵 The Roman nonna who loses sleep every time someone adds cream to carbonara
- 🌮 Kevin, who was right about tacos from the very beginning and deserves a formal apology
- 🎲 The dice, who asks for nothing and gives everything
